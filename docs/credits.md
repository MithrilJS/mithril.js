Mithril was originally written by Leo Horie, but it is where it is today thanks to the hard work and great ideas of many people.

Special thanks to:

- Pat Cavit, who exposed most of the public API for Mithril 1.0, brought in test coverage and automated the publishing process
- Isiah Meadows, who brought in linting, modernized the test suite and has been a strong voice in design discussions
- Zoli Kahan, who replaced the original Promise implementation with one that actually worked properly
- Alec Embke, who single-handedly wrote the JSON-P implementation
- Barney Carroll, who suggested many great ideas and relentlessly pushed Mithril to the limit to uncover design issues prior to Mithril 1.0
- Dominic Gannaway, who offered insanely meticulous technical insight into rendering performance
- Boris Letocha, whose search space reduction algorithm is the basis for Mithril's virtual DOM engine
- Joel Richard, whose monomorphic virtual DOM structure is the basis for Mithril's vnode implementation
- Simon Friis Vindum, whose open source work was an inspiration to many design decisions for Mithril 1.0
- Boris Kaul, for his awesome work on the benchmarking tools used to develop Mithril
- Leon Sorokin, for writing a DOM instrumentation tool that helped improve performance in Mithril 1.0
- Jordan Walke, whose work on React was prior art to the implementation of keys in Mithril
- Pierre-Yves GÃ©rardy, who consistently makes high quality contributions
- Gyandeep Singh, who contributed significant IE performance improvements

Other people who also deserve recognition:

- the countless people who have reported and fixed bugs, participated in discussions, and helped promote Mithril
