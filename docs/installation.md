## Installation

Mithril is available from a variety of sources:

---

### Direct download

You can [download a zip of the latest version here](mithril.min.zip).

Links to older versions can be found in the [change log](change-log.html).

In order to use Mithril, extract it from the zip file and point a script tag to the `.js` file:

```markup
<script src="mithril.min.js"></script>
```

Note that in order to support older versions of IE, you need to include [some shims](tools.md#internet-explorer-compatibility).

---

### CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)

You can also find Mithril in [cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com/libraries/mithril/) and [jsDelivr](http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!mithril).

Content delivery networks allow the library to be cached across different websites that use the same version of the framework, and help reduce latency by serving the files from a server that is physically near the user's location.

#### cdnjs

```markup
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mithril/$version/mithril.min.js"></script>
```

#### jsDelivr

```markup
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/mithril/$version/mithril.min.js"></script>
```
