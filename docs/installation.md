# Installation

### NPM

NPM (Node package manager) is the default package manager that is bundled w/ Node.js. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org); NPM will be automatically installed as well.

To use Mithril via NPM:

- go to your project folder, and run `npm init` from the command line. This will ask some questions (you can just press enter in all of them to set default values), and a file called `package.json` will be created.
- run `npm install mithril --save`. This will create a folder called `node_modules`, and a `mithril` folder inside of it.
