    label: Mithril.js Version
    description: |
      Provide the exact version of Mithril.js you're experiencing these issues with. This
      matters, even if it's really old like version 0.1.0. Do note that bugs in older
      versions are commonly fixed in newer versions, so you should try to test it
      against the latest version if you can.
  validations:
    required: true
- type: textarea
  attributes:
    label: Browser and OS
    description: |
      Provide the name and version of both the browser and operating system you're
      experiencing these issues with. If it's multiple, feel free to list multiple.
      This matters, even if it's super ancient.

    label: Project

      (Optional) Provide a link to your project, if it happens to be open source or if
      you created a repo somewhere that we can look into further. If it's spread across
      multiple repos or projects, feel free to list them all.

      What did you try? What code is causing the unexpected behavior? Make sure to
      try to reduce your code as best as you can while still reproducing the bug, so
      we can more accurately determine the cause. Ideally, it should just be a bunch
      of Mithril.js calls with virtually no logic at all, but it's sufficient to just
      remove unrelated network calls, attributes, and the like.

      In addition, make sure the bug still persists with the latest version of
      Mithril. If it's an older version, the bug may have already been fixed.

      If you'd prefer, replace this code block with a link to a code playground like
      any of these:

      - Flems <https://flems.io/mithril> (stores everything in URL hash)
      - JSFiddle <https://jsfiddle.net>
      - CodePen <https://codepen.io>
      - JSBin <https://jsbin.com>
      - Plunker <https://plnkr.co>
      - Glitch <https://glitch.com> (supports backend)
      - CodeSandbox <https://codesandbox.io> (supports backend)

      Or if it's a remote development project on your own server, feel free to provide
      that if it's serving unminified code we can look at.

      If it's a closed-source repo, it's okay to censor names and pull out irrelevant
      logic - we'd rather not sign NDAs just to see the code you're having trouble
      with. We do still need code of some kind that triggers the bug you're running
      into.
