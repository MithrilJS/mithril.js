/**
 * A general-purpose bi-edge throttler, with a dynamically configurable limit. It's much better
 * than your typical `throttle(f, ms)` because it lets you easily separate the trigger and reaction
 * using a single shared, encapsulated state object. That same separation is also used to make the
 * rate limit dynamically reconfigurable on hit.
 *
 * Create as `throttled = m.throttler(ms)` and do `if (await throttled()) return` to rate-limit
 * the code that follows. The result is one of three values, to allow you to identify edges:
 *
 * - Leading edge: `undefined`
 * - Trailing edge: `false`, returned only if a second call was made
 * - No edge: `true`
 *
 * Call `throttled.update(ms)` to update the interval. This not only impacts future delays, but also any current one.
 *
 * To dispose, like on component removal, call `throttled.dispose()`.
 *
 * If you don't sepecify a delay, it defaults to 500ms on creation, which works well enough for
 * most needs. There is no default for `throttled.update(...)` - you must specify one explicitly.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * ```js
 * const throttled = m.throttler()
 * let results, error
 * return (_attrs, _old, {redraw}) => [
 *     m.remove(throttled.dispose),
 *     m("input[type=search]", {
 *         async oninput(ev) {
 *             if (await throttled()) return false // Skip redraw if rate limited - it's pointless
 *             error = results = null
 *             redraw()
 *             try {
 *                 const response = await fetch(m.p("/search", {q: ev.target.value}))
 *                 if (response.ok) {
 *                     results = await response.json()
 *                 } else {
 *                     error = await response.text()
 *                 }
 *             } catch (e) {
 *                 error = e.message
 *             }
 *         },
 *     }),
 *     results.map((result) => m(SearchResult, {result})),
 *     !error || m(ErrorDisplay, {error})),
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * Important note: due to the way this is implemented in basically all runtimes, the throttler's
 * clock might not tick during sleep, so if you do `await throttled()` and immediately sleep in a
 * low-power state for 5 minutes, you might have to wait another 10 minutes after resuming to a
 * high-power state.
